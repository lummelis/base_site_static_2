			<h3>Logo</h3>
			<p>Make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere for something summery; colourful. Concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution could you solutionize that for me, nor I want you to take it to the next level, so make it look like Apple, nor it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do, for low resolution? It looks ok on my screen.</p>

			<h3>Website</h3>
			<p>Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost. We are your relatives. That's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please this red is too red, for give us a complimentary logo along with the website the website doesn't have the theme i was going for. This is just a 5 minutes job mmm, exactly like that, but different there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time, or I want you to take it to the next level.</p>
