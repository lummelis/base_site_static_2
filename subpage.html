            </section>
            
            <section id="section2">

                <p>Concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution could you solutionize that for me, nor I want you to take it to the next level, so make it look like Apple, nor it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do, for low resolution? It looks ok on my screen.</p>
                
            </section>
            
            <section id="section4">
                
                <h2>Section 4</h2>
                <p>Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost. We are your relatives.  </p>
                <p>That's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please this red is too red, for give us a complimentary logo along with the website the website doesn't have the theme i was going for.</p>
                
            </section>
            
            <section id="section5">
                
                <h2>Section 5</h2>
                <p>This is just a 5 minutes job mmm, exactly like that, but different there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time, or I want you to take it to the next level.</p>
                <p>We are a startup you might wanna give it another shot anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do, or can we try some other colors maybe.</p>
